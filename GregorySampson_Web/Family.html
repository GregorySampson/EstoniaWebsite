    <p class="text_column"><br>
Discover the capital, Tallinn. Its UNESCO World Heritage listed Old Town, a maze of cobbled streets and tall medieval buildings, rises to the Toompea Hill with its great views over the new and old cities. In high summer the Toomas train trundles its way through the Old Town. The Kalev Waterpark (see also Where to Stay) and the hands-on Children's Museum are both popular with kids, or for outdoors fun, Stroomi beach has five playgrounds on the edge of a wood, and Harjumägi Hill in the heart of the Old Town is an ice-skating area in winter and a playground in summer. There’s also a city zoo.<br>
    </p>
	
    <p class="text_column"><br>
Head to the Estonian Open Air Museum, 15 minutes from the centre of Tallinn, for a hands-on glimpse of local rural and village life through reconstructed buildings that include a school, farms, dwellings and small museum.<br>
    </p>
	
	 <p class="text_column"><br>
Venture to the wide open sandy beaches at the historical seaside resort of Pärnu on Estonia's west coast, just under 2hrs south of Tallinn, and on its many islands, including Saaremaa with its working windmills – perfect for family holidays. Don’t miss the chance to spend a few hours up in the trees at the region’s Valgeranna Adventure Park.<br>
    </p>
	
	 <p class="text_column"><br>
Ski  – Otepää in the south attracts skiers (both downhill and cross-country) and snowmobile riders, as well as ice-fishers. In summer, these uplands host the Leigo Lake Music Festival, with lots of open-air concerts..<br>

<h2 class="parallax">A Family Destination</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description">Things are changing fast in the Baltic country of Estonia, which regained independence from Soviet rule almost 20 years ago. With its historic capital Tallinn having served as a European Capital of Culture in 2011 and with several low-cost flights now serving the country from the UK and Ireland, this is a prime time to discover this increasingly popular destination that, abounding with forests and open spaces – including some splendid beaches – is a great setting for outdoor family adventures.</p>

    <p class="text_column"><br>
Russian, German and Scandinavian influences can all be felt in Estonian cuisine, which boasts as its national dish blood sausage (verivorst) with sauerkraut stew (mulgikapsad) and includes other such hearty fare as potato salad (kartulisalat), marinated eel (marineeritud angerjas) and tongue with horseradish (keel hernestega), plus wild boar, elk, deer and sometimes also bear, and freshwater fish including salmon. Vegetarians may struggle.

    <p class="text_column"><br>

Tallinn, however, has an increasing number of Western offerings, making life a bit easier on family holidays. In its main piazza, you can enjoy everything from steaks or pizza to curry. Several restaurants in the Old Town afford themed medieval experiences, with costumed staff and minstrels, that may prove entertaining to children. Alternatively, Tallinn has a few French and Italian restaurants, plus ‘ethnic’ offerings ranging from Greek to Middle Eastern, African and Chinese.

Don’t leave the city without a visit to Anneli Viik’s chocolate café in the Old Town. The cakes are great in Estonia, too, as are the pancakes.<br>
