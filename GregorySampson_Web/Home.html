    <p class="parallax_description">“Estonia is one of the great success stories among the nations that reclaimed their independence after the Cold War. You’ve built a vibrant democracy and new prosperity, and you’ve become a model for how citizens can interact with their government in the 21st century, something President Ilves has championed. With their digital IDs, Estonians can use their smart phones to get just about anything done online – from their children’s grades to their health records. I should have called the Estonians when we were setting up our health-care website.” - Barack Obama</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <img src="images/blk.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p class="cardstxt">The Estonians are a Finno-Ugric people related to the Finns. A first century Roman writer named Tacitus mentioned the Estonians. He called them the Aesti. Amber was exported from Estonia to other parts of Europe.
However for centuries the tribes of Estonia had little contact with Western civilization. They traded with the Vikings. In the 11th and 12th centuries the Estonians fought the Russians several times and they remained unconquered.In 1202 Albert von Buxhoeveden the bishop of Riga founded an order of crusading knights called the Knights of the Sword to subdue the pagans. In 1237 the Knights of the Sword were absorbed into another crusading order, the Teutonic Knights. In the 13th century Estonia was split in two. The Teutonic knights ruled southern Estonia while the Danes ruled the north. Germanic people became the ruling class in Estonia. They remained the upper class until the 20th century. However the Estonians did not accept the situation. In 1343-1346 they rebelled in the St George's Night Uprising. However the rebellion was crushed. In the 16th century both Sweden and Russia coveted Estonia. In 1558 the Russians invaded Estonia.  In 1710 plague struck Tallinn and tens of thousands of people died. Moreover Sweden and Russia fought another war, the Great Northern War at the beginning of the 18th century. When the war ended in 1721 the Swedes ceded Estonia to the Russians.</p>
