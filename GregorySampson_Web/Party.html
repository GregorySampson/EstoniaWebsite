    <p class="text_column">Tallinn and Helsinki: connected through the ages Finland and Estonia have historical and cultural roots that put them in a separate category from bordering nations in the Baltic region. For starters, the two share a language family – Finno-Ugric – which brings together the slightly odd combination of Finnish with Estonian and Hungarian and separates these from Latvian and Lithuanian, which make up the Baltic language family, as well as neighbouring Scandinavian languages. </p>
		
    <p class="text_column">The Tallinn-Helsinki ferry isn’t the first booze cruise to ply Baltic waters. In the 18th century, British ships sailed from the Thames up through the Gulf of Finland carrying dark English ales favoured by the Russian empress Catherine the Great. Crews stopped en route and the drink became popular at ports throughout the Baltics, where eventually it was mixed with other styles of brewing from Germany and beyond, resulting in a uniquely dark, rich beer. This black magic would later be dubbed ‘Baltic porter’ by beer writer Michael Jackson, and it is a style that has grown in complexity and popularity through the centuries, with many craft brewers in Finland, Estonia, Poland and beyond brewing it today. </p>

<h2 class="parallax">Night Life</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description">When the sun goes down in Estonia, the nocturnal culture and music scene comes alive. Tallinn’s most popular bars and clubs are easy to find during a nighttime stroll - simply follow the pulsing music to its source, usually in the Old Town or Telliskivi. However some of the best spots are hidden, or not in Tallinn at all. These hangouts feature the best live music of all genres, cocktails, late-night snacks and quirky happenings. The age for consuming alcohol in Estonia, as well as for entering bars and nightclubs, is 18 years, so bring a piece of identification with you on your night out.</p>

    <p class="text_column"><br>
For travellers designing a whole weekend of cross-Baltic delights, it makes more sense to base in Tallinn, which is easy to navigate and awash in affordable accommodation, historical sights and surprisingly affordable upmarket restaurants.

Beer lovers will want to head to local brewery Põhjala for a start. The brewery takes a nod from its Estonian heritage to make its brews – its ‘Forest Series’ beers use ingredients like birch bark, lingonberry and herbs foraged from the Estonian woods. And in keeping with those roots, they have opened a brand new brewing space and taproom (with its own sauna!) in a heritage building in Tallinn that was a former shipbuilding warehouse.<br>
    </p>
	
    <p class="text_column"><br>
You can also sample local beers at brewpub Humalakoda and craft beer bar Pudel, which are located in the city’s gentrified former railway warehouse district, Telliskivi Creative City. You’ll want to earmark a whole night out to crawl between cocktails, food and wine amongst the trendy restaurants and bars here – don’t miss the area’s trendsetting first restaurant F-hoone.<br>
