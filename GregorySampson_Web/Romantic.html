Tallinn Old Town:<br>
    </p>
	
    <p class="text_column"><br>
Divided between a fortified upper portion and lively lower section, Tallinn Old Town, now a World Heritage Site, represents the historic heart of Estonia. Defended by imposing walls and 26 surviving watchtowers, the city is one of the best preserved in Europe. Wander the winding, cobbled streets surrounded by Hanseatic-style architecture and buildings dating from as far back as the 11th century. Climb up the steep steps to the castle-like upper town, where the city's elite once lived. You'll be rewarded with sweeping views of the city and the Gulf of Finland, accented by a multitude of church spires and towers. For the clearest panoramas, head to the viewing platforms around the edges of the walls.<br>

Parnu Beach Promenade: <br>
    </p>
	
	<p class="text_column"><br>
Explore and relax by the Baltic Sea at Parnu Beach Promenade. The promenade is located along one of Estonia's most popular coastal areas. Enjoy an easy walk on the long, paved pathway, which is lined with benches. Sit to take in the scenery and people-watch. On your stroll, you'll pass fountains, parks, and many spots where you can grab a bite to eat. Of course, leave some time for just kicking back on the sand and watching the waves.<br>

<h2 class="parallax">General information</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description">May through to the end of August is the best time to visit Estonia if you want to make the most of its Baltic beaches, inland lakes and offshore islands. Winter has a magical charm of its own though, with fairytale forests covered in snow. And the best thing about winter in Estonia? The saunas, of course - where you can purify your skin and spirit at the same time as thawing out.</p>

Tartu Old City:<br>
    </p>
	
    <p class="text_column"><br>
With winding streets and a host of neoclassical buildings, Tartu Old City serves as a cultural and spiritual hub. Though much of the medieval old town was destroyed in a late 18th-century fire, you'll find the area has rejuvenated in the centuries since. Explore the many churches, squares, and corridors. Stop by the Town Hall and St. John's Church, two of the surviving medieval buildings that harken back to Tartu's highly respected position in old Estonia. After wandering for a while, stop in one of the many cafes along the streets to relax and people-watch over a cup of coffee.<br>

    <p class="text_column"><br>
Pirita, Tallinn:<br>
    </p>
	
    <p class="text_column"><br>
Nestled against the shores of the Gulf of Finland, Pirita features the city's largest beach and some of its most upscale residential areas. Once a separate town, the area was incorporated into the national capital during the 20th century. Visit the district and explore its multitude of beachfront spaces, including Tallinn's premier waterfront area, complete with soft sand and boardwalks. You'll find that the area's heavily forested landscape and gardens feel like a far cry from the nearby urban bustle. Don't miss seeing the ruins of the convent of St. Bridget, a 15th-century complex that gave birth to the neighborhood itself. <br>
